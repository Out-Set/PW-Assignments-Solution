1.What are Primitive Data types in Java?
---------------------------------------
Answer: int, char, double, float, boolean, byte and short.



2.What are the Identifiers in Java?
-----------------------------------
Answer: 
->Identifiers are symbols used in programming languages to name entities such as variables,functions, classes, or other items. 
->Identifiers are case-sensitive.
->Can not start with numbers.
->Start with a letter, underscore or $.
->Reserved words or keywords can not be used as Identifiers.



3.What is the final class in Java?
-----------------------------------
Answer: 
->Final class is a class that cannot be subclassed or extended. 
->When a class is declared as final, it means that it cannot be used as a superclass, and no other class can inherit from it. 
->This is achieved by using the final keyword in the class declaration.
->It can also be used with methods and variables within a class to achieve similar effects.



4.What are the two ways to make a class final?
----------------------------------------------
Answer: 
1.You can use the final keyword in the class declaration.
	final class MyClass { }
2.Using a private constructor in a class.
	public class MyClass {
    		private MyClass() { }
	}


5.Can we create an Instance of final class in another class?
------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: No, you cannot create an instance of a final class, whether it's in the same class or another class. 
	This restriction applies universally, regardless of whether you're trying to create an instance within the same class or from another class.




6.What is the Volatile keyword used for?
-----------------------------------------
Answer: Suppose, If two threads(t1 and t2) are accessing the same object and updating a variable which is declared as 'volatile'.
	Then it meanns that t1 and t2 can make their own local cache of object except the variable which is declared as 'volatile'.
	So the 'volatile' variable will have only one main copy which will be updated by different threads and update made by one thread
	to the volatile variable will reflect to the other thread.




7.What is the use of Transient keyword?
---------------------------------------
Answer: Transient keyword is used in Serialization.
	If you do not want to Serialize any data member of the class, you can make it as Transient.
	i.e. transient private String myVar;



8.What are the types of Casting?
--------------------------------
Answer: 
1.Primitive Casting: When the data is casted from one primitive type ( like int, float, double etc...) to another primitive type, then it is called primitive casting.
2.Derived Casting: When the data is casted from one derived type to another derived type, then it is called derived casting.



9.What is Boxing and Unboxing?
------------------------------
Answer: 
Boxing or Autoboxing: The automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corrosponding wrapper classes.
byte      --> Byte
boolean   --> Boolean
char      --> Character
double    --> Double
int       --> Integer
float     --> Float
long      --> Long
short     --> Short

Unboxing: The automatic conversion of wrapper types into it's corrosponding primitive type.
	  Opposite of Autoboxing.
Byte        --> byte
Boolean     --> boolean
Character   --> char
Double      --> double
Integer     --> int
Float       --> float
Long        --> long
Short       --> short


10.What is the difference between keywords, Identifiers and literals in java?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: 
keywords -> Reserve words in any programming language.
Identifiers -> Names given to any variable, function, label or class.
literals -> Literals represent constant values that are used in the code. 
	    Can be of various types, such as numeric, string, boolean, character and null literal.
	    i.e. 10, "hello", true, 'B', 'null' ....
